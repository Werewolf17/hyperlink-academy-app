This is a template for outlining a few simple steps for how students should start with the course.

Please edit this topic to include most or all of the following elements â€” or anything else you like!

## Introductions

Replace with: brief note encouraging participants to introduce themselves in this topic. Something like:

Please post a brief intro below! Let everyone know who you are, why you're taking this course, and what you hope to learn. And say hello to other participants; let's get to know each other!

## Logistics

Replace with: notes about any logistical details participants need to know. 

Any other tools / services participants will need to sign up for or download (e.g. Google Drive, Zoom, etc.)? Materials to prepare? Be sure to let everyone know any preliminary action items.

This topic contains details for this particular cohort of the course. Right now you're in the cohort forum, just for members of this cohort. Note that there is also a main course forum.

## Start Learning!

Replace with: any day-one action items that participants should complete prior to the first meeting of the course. First first reading(s) or assignment(s)? Share those here.
