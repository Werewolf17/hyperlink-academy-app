## What is Hyperlink?

It's a simple, integrated learning platform that makes it easy to facilitate great courses and workshops.

And it's an online school where you can participate in transformative learning experiences with real people — we believe the best learning happens with communities of highly engaged learners, not just file downloads and video playlists.

## How does it work?

Hyperlink courses are created and cultivated by the community. Each course focuses on a specific niche topic, and aims to create unreasonably effective learning.

Courses are run in independent cohorts, each supported by a *facilitator*. If you create a *course*, you can run many *cohorts* of that course. You can also participate as a *learner* in as many cohorts as you like.

Here's what we provide:

- Simple infrastructure for course creation and facilitation
- Hands-on help designing and building your course
- Easy payments with Stripe
- Community discussion space with Discourse
- Network of peers excited to learn together

[TK icons for the above - Celine will add!]

Hyperlink is built on open source software like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/), and [this very website](https://gitlab.com/jaredpereira/hyperlink-academy). You can fork, modify, and contribute to any of it.

We’re experimenting with new courses every day. We’d love for you to join us as a facilitator, learner — or both!
