## Courses

The core building block of hyperlink.academy is a `course`. A course is a system
for learning something. We don't enforce the way courses work. There don't have
to be teachers, lectures, assignments, or anything else you may associate with
the last course you took. 

Instead, a course uses a structure that's best suited to it's learning goals.
Sometimes that may resemble a traditional learning environment, other's it may
look entirely new. Each course is an experiment to discover the system that
makes learning it's subject unreasonably effective.

Towards that end courses can make use of software, created and maintained by the
hyperlink.academy community.
